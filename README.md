# Data Ingestion and Analysis Using Cloudera, HDFS, and Hive

This project demonstrates the process of ingesting, storing, and analyzing large datasets using Cloudera, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and Hive, all implemented within a Docker containerized environment. The workflow showcases an end-to-end pipeline for managing big data, from raw data ingestion to querying and analysis, providing scalable and efficient solutions for data processing.

## Project Overview

### Objectives:
- **Data Ingestion**: Load raw data into HDFS using Cloudera's ecosystem tools.
- **Data Storage**: Organize and manage data in HDFS for distributed and scalable access.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform querying and analytics using Hive to derive actionable insights.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Cloudera**: A comprehensive platform for big data management and analytics.
- **HDFS**: Hadoop's file system for distributed data storage.
- **Hive**: A data warehouse infrastructure for querying and managing large datasets.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for deploying and managing Cloudera and associated tools.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
- Created a Docker container for Cloudera Manager to emulate a distributed big data environment.
- Configured services including HDFS and Hive within the Cloudera setup.

### 2. Data Ingestion
- Loaded raw datasets into HDFS using tools such as `hadoop fs` commands.
- Verified data integrity and structure in HDFS.

### 3. Data Storage
- Organized datasets into appropriate directories and partitions in HDFS to ensure efficient access.
- Applied HDFS replication policies to enhance fault tolerance and reliability.

### 4. Data Analysis
- Utilized Hive to create external tables referencing the ingested data in HDFS.
- Executed SQL-like queries on Hive tables to extract meaningful insights.
- Optimized queries using partitioning and indexing for faster processing.
